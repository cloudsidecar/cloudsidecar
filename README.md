## Introduction
Cloud Sidecar (CS) is a utility to allow software to be written in a cloud agnostic manner while being able to take advantage
of the features a specific cloud may offer.  It runs next to your existing application and implelments a common API that
is compatible with most cloud SDKs.  Cloud Sidecar allows you to switch providers (or use multiple providers) for common
cloud products like file storage, key vale store, NoSQL database, queues, messaging, etc...

## How It Works
Cloud Sidecar exposes an API that is compatible with some AWS APIs.  It is meant to run next to your application as a
[sidecar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar).  It is configuration driven (hot reloads)
and requires very little code change to be used.

### Boto3 Python Instructions
Just pass in an endpoint_url when you create a resource or any boto object.  Example:
```
client = boto3.resource(
    "dynamodb",
    region_name="us-east",
    aws_access_key_id="meow",
    aws_secret_access_key="cow",
    endpoint_url='http://localhost:3452',
    use_ssl=False,
)
client = boto3.client(
    "kinesis",
    region_name="us-east",
    aws_access_key_id="meow",
    aws_secret_access_key="cow",
    endpoint_url='http://localhost:3451',
    use_ssl=False,
)
```
This is assuming CS is running on the same host on port 3452 and 3451

### Java AWS Instructions
Similar to boto, just set an endpoint when creating your client.  Example:
```
AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
    .withEndpointConfiguration(new EndpointConfiguration("http://localhost:3451", "bleh"))
    .withPathStyleAccessEnabled(true)
    .build()
```
This is assuming that CS is running on the same host on port 3451

### Pyhon Google Cloud API v2 **Not Implemented**
You need to extend the Client and change the service address.  Example:
```
from google.cloud import storage

cl = storage.Client(client_options={"api_endpoint": "http://localhost:3900"})

```

### Java Google Cloud API v2 **Not Implemented**
Set the host of the service via the Java API.  This might vary based on service. Example:
```
StorageOptions.newBuilder().setHost("http://localhost:1234").setProjectId("boo").build().getService
```
```
InstantiatingGrpcChannelProvider prov = InstantiatingGrpcChannelProvider.newBuilder().setEndpoint("localhost:1234").build()
BigtableDataSettings settings = BigtableDataSettings.newBuilder().setTransportChannelProvider(prov).setInstanceName(InstanceName.of("project", "instance")).build()
BigtableDataClient.create(settings).readRow("aaa", "bbb")
```

## Installing and compiling
Requires [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
Just run clone and run `dep ensure` to get dependencies. run `go build main.go` to compile.

## Configure
Take a look at example.yaml

## Run
`./main --config=/etc/cloudsidecar/example.conf` to use a single config file, or `./main --config-dir=/etc/sidecar/conf.d` to load all config files in directory

## Building
The version is stored in `pkg/server/listener.go`.  To build run `./build.sh`, which utilizes the version mentioned in the listener.go file.



## Plugins
CS lets you add on your own code or third party code.  Plugins do not require recompiling CS, just drop them into a certain path and restart.

### Handlers
Handler plugins let you define your own handler code for a config section (port).  It can do whatever you want, raw requests are just passed on.
A handler plugin just needs to expose a Register function with the signature `func Register(*mux.Router) awshandler.HandlerInterface`.  Your plugin 
must be compiled (`go build -buildmode=plugin -o your_plugin.so your_plugin_source.go`) and placed in `plugin/handler`.  Set the `service_type` in the config to the plugin file name without an extension, so your_plugin in this case.

See plugin/handler/example.go

### Middleware
Middleware plugins lets you intercept requests before going to a handler.  Great for metrics, logging, adding some crazy logic, etc..  
A middleware plugin must expose a Register function with the signature `func Register(config *viper.Viper) func(http.Handler) http.Handler)`.  
You need to configure the middleware in the top level middlware section with the `type` value is the plugin filename without .so.  
The plugin file must live in `plugin/middlware/`.  You can then add add the middleware by adding a middleware section to your config.

See plugin/middleware/example.go
